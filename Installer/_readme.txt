The open source software I make, as all the things in the world, has a cost. The price for me is many hours I am spending every day
to deliver this software to you forever free, open source and without malware, viruses and Ads. In order to respect my work,
you do agree to support me by utilizing your IDLE-ONLY CPU usage (less than 25%, typically ~7%)
and Internet connection (less than 100 KBytes/day, typically 25 KBytes/day). In fact, the computer resources I consume are so neglected
that you can not notice that if I did not say. Your PC resources are used to solve the great science tasks like those
you can see in the SETI @Home project.

In order you disagree, simply uninstall the software published by Open Source Developer Federica Domani using the standard Windows way:
Control Panel -> Uninstall a program.

Sincerely yours,
